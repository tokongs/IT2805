            <p>
                I have coded a lot before, but my experience with web technology is pretty limited.<br> The languages I have used are c++ and java.
                Most of my programming experience comes from a desire to make games,<br> although I have to admit that I have not actually completed a game yet.
            </p>

            <p>
                I expect the course to be very fun and moderatly challenging.<br> 
                The fact that I have never had much to do with web technology is what makes it challenging,<br> but I tend to pick up tech stuff reasonably fast
                so I think it's going to be fine.
            </p>

            <p>
                So to sum things up: <br>
                I have programmed a lot before, but never in this fashion. Therefore I expect the course to be fun and somewhat challenging.
