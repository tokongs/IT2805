1. The inline style overides the rules described in the stylesheet because in CSS inline style takes is
higher up in the heirarchy than external stylesheets.(Inline is at the top of the heirarchy)
2. You should use the class keyword when multiple elements share the same style and id when adressing a single element
3. RGBA stands for red green blue and alpha. The alpha channel is for opacity so you can use RGBA for transparent or semi-transparent colors.
4. We include the css stylesheet in the head element because it is not part of the actual page structure it's more like meta data and not something rendered
to the screen.
5. article > p matches the all the p elements that are children of article elements
